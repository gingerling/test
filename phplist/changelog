Moved to CVS, changelog is supposed to be automatic now :-)

Old changelog before CVS:

1.1.7 1 Aug 2001
* added importing of lists of emails, part of code contributed by Kaare Christensen, kaare@mermaidconsulting.com
* finally add italian which had been contributed ages ago

1.1.6 12 Jun 2001
* wrapped it all up and published

1.1.5 6 Jun 2001
* added finding a user
* added dynamic selection of stylesheets

1.1.5b 5 Jun 2001 (oops, half a year later)
* added upgrading
* ben made me a nice design
* made stress testing a bit more useful
* some minor fixes related to redesign
* added confirmation of subscription

1.1.4b 6 Dec 2000
* bug in editlist
* bug in deleting a message
* bug in users, not showing no of msgs

1.1.3b 26 October 2000
* showing attributes when viewing user
* typo in unsubscribe_url
* problem with message footer
* host not exported to processing
* added exporting to CSV

1.1.2b 17th October 2000
* bug in members, when adding single user
* added checking for other running send processes, to avoid too many clogging up the machine
  and making the other crawl to a halt

1.1.1b 16th October 2000 - released in beta
* started using PHP4 specific stuff, PHP3 will not work any more
* separated db calls to allow for extension to other DBs
* separated user interface strings to allow translations
* made user attributes databased for more flexible configuration, with loads of consequences:
  - process queue has different method to find users.
  - subscribe uses new listing
  - admin uses new strucure
* users now get UNIQID, which allows them to go back and get their details directly
  (ie site "remembers" them).
* more items for a list or a message, prefix, footer, ordering
* paged listing of users when over 50, both in "all users" and "list membership"
* actions on userlists, move or delete multiple
* changed all files to .php instead of .php3

1.0.1 September 2000 (not published)
* moved config and connect to admin dir to allow password protection of docs
* bit more error capturing
* more help information
* some bugs removed
* different formatting of outgoing from-email

1.0 initial release. April 2000.
