How to install PHPlist

If you've been using the previous public release, make sure to read UPGRADE. If you did, but
you don't mind losing all your data, you can use the methods below.

To install:

(this assumes your webfiles reside in "public_html", and you have created a Mysql database already)

* Take the archive file and unpack it in a temporary directory using "tar zxf phplist-x.y.z.tgz"
* Move the contents of the directory "public_html" to your HTML area. (mv public_html/* ~/public_html)

* You may want to password protect the "admin" directory in the lists directory.
That's up to you. Check your webserver documentation. An example htaccess file for Apache is included,
called "htaccess". If you want to use this, you need to copy the contents to the .htaccess file that
is already in that directory.

* Change the stuff in lists/config/config.php, you certainly will want to change the
database location, username and password and database name.

* Use your browser to go to the admin index on your site (http://www.yoursite.com/lists/admin/).
The system will say it needs initialising. Choose the link and your database will be set up.
Now follow the steps in "setup". You can always get back to that page by clicking "configure" in the
menu on the right.

* Make sure to create at least one subscribe page and make it the default.

Now you're done.

* Processing the message queue
It's useful to make this automatic, so you don't need to think about it, 
but if that's not possible you can do it manually, by using the 
"Process Message Queue" link in the admin page.

To set it up automatically, you can use the commandline option for PHPlist. Read
the stuff in README.commandline to find out how to install the commandline. 
Once it is set up, you can add a regular scheduled process like:

# phplist -pprocessqueue

* Windows and non apache issues
The "trick" to post to the directory will not always work. Particularly users with Windows have
found that they get "Method not allowed" errors, when using PHPlist. If you get this, you should
try to tell your webserver to allow the "POST" method to any URL in the PHPlist tree, particularly
the directories (/lists and /lists/admin by default) themselves. If that doesn't work, you can
set the option in the bottom of the config file, but that's not that neat :-)

If you want to use the FCKeditor (WYSISYG) for your messages, you can do so, by installing it
in a directory called FCKeditor in the admin directory of PHPlist.

That's it.
