If you think you have found a bug,

- make sure you have the latest version of PHPlist (check http://www.phplist.com/files)
  I don't always update the website, but the files directory will always have the latest
  version.

- go to http://bugtrack.tincan.co.uk and check whether someone else
has already reported the same thing. If so, add your comments, and anything
that can be helpful to find and fix the bug to the existing report

- if there is no entry:

- write a clear report with at least the following information:

* Your platform (windows, mac, unix)
* Your PHP version (lists/info.php will help)
* Your Mysql version
* The PHPlist version
* The page the error is on
* What the error is, and what you did when it happened.

I use Mozilla (generally the latest version) on a Linux (Redhat 7.1) system myself,
and I don't have time to check it thoroughly on other systems, so any feedback on
javascript and layout errors on other systems are welcome.

Once you've compiled your bugreport, point your webbrowser at
http://bugtrack.tincan.co.uk and add a new bug report

Thanks in advance for taking the time. Contributions are very much
appreciated, and will help to make PHPlist a solid and useful application
for everyone.
