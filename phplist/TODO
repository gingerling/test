  A searchable archive of the lists, to use via the web
- Allowing running processes to be viewed and killed
- allow choice for multiple send processes
- "preview" of messages to send, so you can check whether the layout is ok
- make system multilingual and allow user to choose language
- placeholder parsing in subscribe, confirm and unsubscribe messages
- system messages need to be identifiable for bounces
- direct delivery of subscription message to make sure it can arrive, and
  give error when it can't
- move configurable stuff outside the webroot, to make upgrading easier
- seperate message for signing up people from import
- statistics retrieval (#lists #users #messages)
- integration with other OSS projects
- bit of cleaning up of files
