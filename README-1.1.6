What is PHPlist
PHPlist is a set of PHP pages that implement a simple mailinglist system. 
It uses Mysql for storing the information. 

###

Particular aspects of the system are: 

= Posting to the mailinglist is via a webpage. It is therefore more a kind of "announcements" 
list system than an actual email mailinglist.
= It is designed to be able to deal with a very large amount of email addresses. 
= Users can sign up to multiple lists. If a message is sent to multiple lists, 
they will only receive one copy of the email and not as many as the number of lists they
are subscribed to. 
= Geographical information. If people sign up, they can identify the geographical 
location they're in and when sending an email you can determine which
locations need to receive the message. 

###

Requirements
To use PHPlist you need a webserver which supports PHP version 4, a Mysql database and possibly 
Perl with the Mysql modules installed.

Installation
- See file: INSTALLATION

Upgrade
- See file: UPGRADE

Some important notes:

* PHP 3 is not supported any more. PHP recently upgraded to 4 and I've followed them in this upgrade.
There are too many useful additions to 4 to stick to 3. Sorry if that's a problem.
* I've made the DB calls and the User interface (not the admin) "abstract" in Database calls and language.
Any contributions in other Database calls and translations are very welcome. Send your contribution to
